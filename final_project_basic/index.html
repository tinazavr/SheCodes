                <em>Borsch</em> is a sour soup common in Eastern Europe and
                Northern Asia. In English, the word "borsch" is most often
                associated with the soup's variant of Ukrainian origin, made
                with red beetroots as one of the main ingredients, which give
                the dish its distinctive red color. The same name, however, is
                also used for a wide selection of sour-tasting soups without
                beetroots, such as sorrel-based green borsch, rye-based white
                borsch, and cabbage borsch.

                Traditionally, pastries in Galicia were called
                <em>plyatsky</em>. They are baked in a large square shape and
                then cut into pieces. They usually combined cakes, cream and
                fillings. It resembles a cake, but easier to prepare. Now the
                most popular Lviv dessert, without a doubt, is Lviv cheesecake.
                It is believed that the original recipe was invented in the
                middle of the twentieth century by the famous chef Daria Tsvek
                and was published in her book "Sweet Cookies". But every
                housewife has her own vision, and now there are more than 30
                recipes for Lviv cheesecake.

                <em>Varenyky</em> are Ukrainian national dish that is not
                inferior in popularity and importance even to borsch. Varenyky
                are made from fresh dough and a variety of fillings, such as
                meat, potatoes, mushrooms, vegetables, fruits, cheese and many
                more. Their fillings can be salty or sweet, lean or meaty.
                Recipes vary greatly depending on the region. Thus, in Polissia,
                crushed beans are added to the filling, in Zakarpattia it is
                cheese, in Chernihiv region bacon crisps are added to the dish.
